# Exercise-Tracker
This is a website that you can sign up for and use to track your exercise habits.
I had used mongoose for the database, bootstrap 4 for styling, jquery for the interface, passport
for authentication, helmetjs for some added security, and bcrypt for hashing passwords. I used pug for
the templating engine, and I used express-validator to sanitize and validate entries to the exercise journal.
Here is a link to the website: https://exercise-tracker-leon.glitch.me/
